            Afro Code is like a DNA Sequence from Jurassic Park, always changing and editing
            lines of code throughout the different evolutions of themselves. Transferring from a community college
            to a university was a step that was new, intriguing but frightening. Few things of comfort came through the
            hard journey: coffee(put emoji here), animals(put emoji here), and new surroundings. Along with
            these new surroundings, new interests came as well.
